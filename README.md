# Atari Breakout
An Atari Breakout game written in TypeScript.

# Getting started
 - Clone this repository,
 - Install dependencies using `npm install`,
 - Compile with `npm build`,
 - Open index.html in your browser (HTTP server recommended),

I have also added npm scripts for:
 - Webpack dev server `npm start`,
 - Webpack compiler in watch mode `npm watch`,
